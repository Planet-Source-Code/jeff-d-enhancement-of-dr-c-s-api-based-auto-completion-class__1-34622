## Enhancement of Dr\. C's API\-based Auto Completion Class


</div>

### Description

This is an enhancement of Dr. C's code submitted today. His code dealt with EASY TO IMPLETEMENT API Based AutoCompletion Class which features an auto-dropdown option for VB Combo Boxes. He should get full credit for the class developed. It is very good work. Further enhancements made to his fine work includes (1) a simple database which loads the combo box with values, (2) a primary module containing useful stuff, (3) Added a Gotfocus and LostFocus to Combo box to manipulate the displayed value, (4) added ENTER key acceptance capability. His original code can be found at http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=34618&lngWId=1. Users can type in some existing value or create a new value "on-the-fly" into the Combobox. Try it and see. I felt many of you would like the changes so I am posting them. Let me know what you think.
